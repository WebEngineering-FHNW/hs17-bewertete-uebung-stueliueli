External contributions: Thanks to [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com), which helped me quite a lot (links in code). Other external contributions:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Other comments: Really needs ECMAScript v6, because I used StringTemplates in `assets/javascripts/form_control.js`

I'm particular proud of: Being able to dynamically add more questions and answers, thanks to JS and jQuery.
